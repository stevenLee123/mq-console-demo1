#Deploy Plan

we will deploy the first rocketmq-console-ng  use rocketmq-tools 3.5.8(or 4.0.0),base on [rocket-console](https://github.com/didapinchegit/rocket-console)，thanks didapinche.com

## Framework
* 0. we use spring-boot + bootstrap + angularjs

## something to improve
* 0. clean code (checkStyle codeStyle to be done)
* 1. international
* 2. compress fe'resource
* 3. navigation bar can improve
* 4. write operation need confirm,action show the detail result
* 5. layout/UI should improve
* 6. change to spring-boot


## something to fix

* consumer can consume the message when topic has been deleted
* can't show producerList,we can only query a online producer use topic and groupName,not easy to use.
* resetOffset should be improve,online consumer can return the reset result but offline's can't
* we can't set clusterName when create topic or consumer 
* when create a new consumer,if not be consumed,can't be found in consumerList


## something to add
* 1. dashboard
